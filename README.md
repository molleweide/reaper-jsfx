  between multiple and various (midi) devices. 
- easy to update and sync layouts between keyboards. 
  Use this to mirror layout between virtual keyboard and
  qmk.
- sequential vim style commands for updating and managing 
  midi settings/fx so that one can touch type/play on ones
  midi instrument and avoid being a noob.
